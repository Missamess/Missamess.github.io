    <h2 id="earlyyears">Early Years</h2>

    <p><strong>Drag Me Out</strong> is a metalcore band based in Ukraine, consisting of members Denis Shaforostov (vocals and songwriting), Chris Nokia (percussion), Kir Medvedev (bass guitar and background vocals), and Stas Belov (electric guitar and songwriting). They operate mainly in the English dialect for marketability purposes as well as the inflections of English verbage in a musical piece. Initially formed in 2018 under the name "Heartsigh," there are only minimal records of this early age of Drag Me Out's formation. Only one original unused "demo" piece has been formed from this era named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb7It_EabWk">"Kill Your Idols"</a> while other recordings of the now removed song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQGWpg79JMQ">"Hollow"</a> also exist as an unnofficial remix release titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR-WUnDjtSs">"Hollow (Feat. Tris Mikal)."</a> Many other demos of current Drag Me Out pieces appearing on their debut album "Pressure" exist but are of little note due to being lower quality mixes of what is present on streaming services today.</p>

    <p>After completely forming in 2019 to surprise-release their debut album <a href="https://youtu.be/I-LE7PiChH8">"Pressure"</a> the band had created a sonic personality unlike any other music in the world of rock. Filled with experimental sounds and looseley comparable to "noise rock," the album may be descirbed as an electo-atmoshperic ride thru a modern mind infatuated with the energy cought between social relations, introspection, and broken romanticism. The album has been archived as a relase of great improtance in defying traditional rock and metal standards.</p>

    <p>With the band's venture into further projects, it was relatively unknown in which direction their music would move sonically. While the attirbutes of "Pressure" were difficult to recreate beyond what had already been created, a new, "heavier" sound would be implmented to the likes of Denis Shaforostov's previous band named "Down & Dirty" While most pieces in Drag Me Out's debut album concentrated on ambmient intervals followed by relatively high-tuned electric guitar sections, Demons Away sought to create a more nightmarish soundscape with more industrial samples but keeping a sense of atmopsphere with synthetic processors. Unlike their previous album, Demons Away had many "leaked" tracks, including snippets of the soon-to-be named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjNODrEY9gk">"Crystal Arms,"</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDPxGomQAHQ">"Hymn for the Wicked,"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsGY1OEpIg">"No Feelings."</a></p>
